	<h4>ABOUT US</h4>
	<p>Beauty&Grooming.com is a marketplace to "Discover Unique Indian
		Products" including Handmade, Vintage, Ethnic, Organic and Natural
		products from India.</p>
	
	<p>India is a beautiful assortment of diversity reflected in our
		Clothing, Food, Lifestyle, Language, Music, Books etc. This diversity
		is so rich and diverse that an attempt to capture it on a single
		platform was never made. Beauty&Grooming.com is that sincere attempt
		by bunch of young insane gals who think this is possible now with the
		Internet.</p>
	
	<p>Beauty&Grooming.com uses a marketplace model to capture the
		regional variations of India. We connect local artisans & designers
		directly to global customers and thereby increase their livelihood,
		remove middlemen, help them create/promote their brand and thereby
		preserve our culture, traditions and values. We believe this journey
		will not only help artisans of India but also help customers discover
		and buy products which they otherwise are not able to do today.</p>
	
	<p>As they say starting Beauty&Grooming.com was fate, reaching out
		to artisans was a choice, but falling in love with the idea of India
		was beyond our control. Lets relive that old India together again.</p>
